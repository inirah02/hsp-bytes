Yes, you are right. This is not about any tantalising rasberry pies but instead, its about one of the most resourceful component of any technical project. Let's take a deep dive into what Rasberry Pi actually was and how its evolved till date.


For several years, TV news has talked about “IoT” and “deep learning.” The technology surrounding these innovations has become widely recognized, and not just among engineers. You’ve probably heard about these developments and may also be wondering about the “Raspberry Pi” device mentioned so often in these types of news stories.

Raspberry Pi is a type of circuit board developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation in the UK. It’s a “single-board computer” built for educational use. A typical model looks like the picture above and comes equipped with electronic components and terminals.

The circuit boards that are populated with these types of electronic components are often called “boards” (not “circuit boards”), or more specifically, “single-board computers,” and the whole unit is referred to as a Raspberry Pi. They are designed to be smaller in size, and they have a lower cost and power consumption by focusing only on the components necessary to function as a PC.

Raspberry Pi was developed as an educational computer. In recent years, the spread of electronic terminals – such as smartphones and PCs – has enabled young people, more than ever before, to use these devices without first learning about them in school. But few people know how they work or can do their own programming and software development. This is also attributed to the fact that electronics have more advanced capabilities now and more complete products are available, giving people less opportunity to disassemble equipment and create their own hardware and software.

That’s why Raspberry Pi began to develop prototypes. The founder of the Raspberry Pi Foundation, Evan Upton, as well as several others, came up with inexpensive computers that could be easily programmed by children with less risk of costly damage. More and more users are now using these types of computers, not only for education but also for hobby applications such as electronic devices and robots.

The name Raspberry Pi is derived from the fruit pie, raspberry pie. This is because many companies in the computer neighborhood where Raspberry Pi was based used fruit names such as Apple and apricot as names for their companies and products. “Pi” is also associated with the programming language “Python.” In Japan, this is often referred to with the abbreviation “razu-pai.”
