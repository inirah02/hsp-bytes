## In the first edition of HSP Bytes, we have Automated Retinal Disease Assessment as part of the Industry Stories on New Technology.

The human body is not infallible, but through the wonders of A.I. research scientists are finding ways to address those imperfections. One of those areas of research is through the human eye to detect diabetic retinopathy.

ARDA, uses artificial intelligence to help healthcare workers detect diabetic retinopathy, with future possibilities of AI algorithms to assist clinicians in identifying other diseases.

Diabetic retinopathy creates lesions in the back of the retina that can lead to total blindness. It’s important to screen people diagnosed with diabetes early, but with over 420 million people with diabetes globally, checking on every patient is an impossible task. Both the lack of awareness of the disease and the resources to screen it are huge issues. Google’s artificial intelligence accurately interpreted retinal scans to detect diabetic retinopathy. The tricky part was creating a data set for the AI model to learn from – a task which required a large team of ophthalmologists scoring and labeling scans one by one for different grades of severity.


Lets look into a real life scenario of how this problem was tackled using latest technological tools.
Google research scientist Varun Gulshan was looking for a project that would meet a few criteria. The project would utilise Gulshan’s background developing artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and stimulate his interest in science and medicine. And ideally, the project would help people in Gulshan’s home country of India.

He fired off an email to Phil Nelson, Director of Google Accelerated Science (GAS), asking if there was such a project in the works.

A few weeks later, Gulshan was opening a digital drive containing hundreds of anonymised retina scans from a hospital in India. Nelson thought that he had a project for Gulshan, but first he needed to know: could an artificial intelligence model learn to identify which of these images showed signs of a specific cause of blindness, a disease called diabetic retinopathy?

'This was like a perfect skill-set match for me', says Gulshan, whose background was working with AI to recognise hand gestures. 'When I looked at these images, I could tell that, OK, deep learning is kind of working well enough', he says. 'We could really use it on these problems.'

## A Growing Concern:

With 70 million people with diabetes, India has a growing problem with diabetic retinopathy. The disease creates lesions in the back of the retina that can lead to total blindness, and 18 per cent of diabetic Indians already have the ailment. With 415 million diabetics at risk for blindness worldwide (the United States, China and India have the most cases), the disease is a global concern.

But the good news is that permanent vision loss is not inevitable. For those who are diagnosed early enough, medications, therapies, exercise and a healthy diet are highly effective treatments for preventing further damage.

## The Challenges:

Awareness is a huge issue with diabetic retinopathy. Many diabetic patients assume that early signs of the disease are simply minor vision problems, according to Dr. Rajiv Raman, a retina surgeon at Sankara Nethralaya Eye Hospital in Chennai, India. With no word in Hindi for 'retina', just talking about the disease is a challenge. 'For cataracts we have a word, for glaucoma we have a word in Hindi as well as in Tamil, but diabetic retinopathy is – there is no translational word', Dr. Raman says.

But while an ophthalmologist can explain the disease and how regular exams will monitor its progress, the real difficulty is getting at-risk patients a retinal exam in the first place. For rural communities worldwide, the prevalence of late-stage diabetic retinopathy has more to do with infrastructure than medicine. The journey from home to the nearest specialist can be long, and keeping multiple appointments is often very difficult.

'Many of the rural patients have an advanced stage of diabetic retinopathy, but they don’t know they are diabetics'

It is often impossible for patients in poverty with dependents to also care for themselves. Instead, they will carry on until the effects of diabetic retinopathy become too bad to ignore, which is often too late. 'Many of the rural patients have an advanced stage of diabetic retinopathy, but they don’t know they are diabetics', says Dr. Sheila John, head of teleophthalmology at Sankara Nethralaya. 'They are losing sight. In some cases they have lost vision in one eye, [and] the other eye we have to save.'

At the outset, the team was aided by ophthalmologists at Aravind and Sankara Nethralaya to label the retina images. After a few short months, the model was trained to identify key markers of diabetic retinopathy, such as nerve tissue damage, swelling and hemorrhaging. And with a larger data set, Gulshan was sure that they could make the model even more accurate.

Enter Dr. Jorge Cuadros, head of the Eye Picture Archive Communication System (EyePACS), a telemedicine network connecting patients in rural areas across the United States to opthamologists for diabetic retinopathy scans. But patients seen by EyePACS still have to wait weeks for a graded scan, and Dr. Cuadros was happy to help any effort for a faster diagnosis.

The data EyePACS shared comprised a wide range of patients and was a hundred times as much as the AI team had gathered by that point. That meant a huge labelling workload because each image had to be graded multiple times to compensate for the bias of different graders. 'The model learns what things they always did consistently', says Dale Webster, a software engineer at Google. 'This tends to result in something that’s a bit less biased and a bit more robust.'

To date, close to 100 ophthalmologists have rendered more than 1 million grades for the AI model.
