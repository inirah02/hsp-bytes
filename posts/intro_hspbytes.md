Amidst a routine HackerSpace ECC club meeting, the idea of building a newsletter exclusively for students that would act as a noble guide in the expansive world of tech was homebrewed. Thus, the Homebrew community brings to you, HSP BYTES; also known as the HackerSpace Bytes, an all in one newsletter that brings all kinds of information on the latest innovations and happenings in a bite-sized manner. 

A biweekly technology newsletter which includes:

## Interviews with industry experts

First hand exposure to impactful talks by leading technologists that provide real life impact with applications being built across the globe. 

## How-to articles for common problems

Easy-to-follow written documentation for some of the most frequently asked questions covering everything from installing dependencies to complex debugging techniques and/or tricks.

##  White papers on trending industry topics

Research papers; an integral component of building new solutions. Learn about the latest innovations and discoveries across all domains and also find useful tips on how to get started in publishing one, yourself!

## Industry stories on new technology

Read about how new tech tools affect various industries, their market segments and how they get affected by the solutions they build.

## Product features with benefits

Stay updated with the current happenings and benefits of emerging technological products. It may just tinker you to innovate them and put your own spin on it as well!

## Community Blogs

Use this as a student spotlight! Send in your blogs about anything tech; new learnings, experiences or developments and we'll help you share it with your peers across the whole campus!

## Coding Brain Teasers

Enough reading, let's get some hands on work as well. These teasers will help you rethink your approach and optimise your code.

## Roots Decoded

Always a good idea to track back the roots and see how far explorations and innovations have brought us.
